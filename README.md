# ScottBot

A discord bot primarily tasked with providing music services for a private discord server I am a member of.
The name "ScottBot" derives it's name from Scott Oelkers, then CEO of Dominos Pizza Japan, who appeared in a famous advert for a short-lived 
Dominos x Hatsune Miku application for the Japanese Market. It didn't last long, but the spirit of the app lives on in the name of our 
Discord Server and this application.
